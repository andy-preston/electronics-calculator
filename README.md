Electronics Calculators
=======================

Potential Divider calculator
----------------------------

Give it an input voltage an output voltage and a catalogue of available
resistors and it'll get you as close as possible.

25Hz RC Filter calculator
-------------------------

Calculate the resistor and capacitor to form the first stage filter to clip
a 25Hz square wave to a sine wave.

This filter will probably need 4 stages but "one step at a time".
